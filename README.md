# Swift Cross-compilation SDK bundles

Stores cross compilation sdk bundles aligned with Swift releases.
A release is created for each Swift release. The assets on the release contain the SDK bundles.

The bundles are created using the [Swift SDK Generator](https://github.com/apple/swift-sdk-generator) tool.
